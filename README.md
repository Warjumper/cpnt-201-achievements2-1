## Node express - Hello World

### By Jesse H

## Process notes;
- I was confused by the terms "save it in the dependencies list" and "To install Express temporarily and not add it to the dependencies list", so I did some googling to better understand the definitions of them.
- I got the example app listening on port 3000, and running it from http://localhost:3000/ in a browser showed me the hello world output.
